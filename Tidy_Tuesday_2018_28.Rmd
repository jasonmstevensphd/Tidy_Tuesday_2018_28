## How A Booming Population And Climate Change Made Californiaâ€™s Wildfires Worse Than Ever

This is my take on the 2018 August 21 dataset provided by rfordatascience/tidytuesday.

The article related to this dataset can be found here:

All the following code for this exercise can be found at my github repo here:

Here we go!

###Initial Exploration of the Dataset

```{r Libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, EVAL=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# This is where we import our libraries and files. We'll also add some information to be included on our plots

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(lubridate)

Week28_Data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018-10-09/voter_turnout.csv")[-1]

Week28_Data <- tolower(Week28_Data$state)

# I include this in my plots to put a time and author stamp on the actual plot

Time_of_Analysis <- now(tz = "America/New_York")
Analyst <- "@jasonmstevens"

# I prefer these settings for plots so I wrap them into an object to be concise

plot <- ggplot()+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",
                                                                        size = 18,
                                                                        color = "navy"))+
                                          theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16))+
                                          theme(aspect.ratio = 3.5/5)

```

###Mapping it out

```{r Map 01, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

library(fiftystater)

Plot_28_01 <- Week28_Data %>% filter(year == "2012", state != "United States", state != "District of Columbia") %>%
  filter(!is.na(eligible_voters))
Plot_28_01 <- ggplot(Plot_28_01, aes(map_id = state)) + 
     geom_map(aes(fill = eligible_voters), map = fifty_states) + 
     expand_limits(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat) +
     coord_map() +
  ggtitle("Map of Eligible Voters by State in the Year 2012!")

Plot_28_01

```
